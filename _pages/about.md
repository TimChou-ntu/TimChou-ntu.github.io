I am Zi Ting Chou, currently pursuing my M.S. degree in the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by Prof. [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html). My primary research interests are deep learning (**DL**) and computer vision (**CV**), particularly focusing on 3D scene understanding with methods like **NeRF** and **3DGS**.

Before my Master's program, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2022. During my last year of studies, I participated in an exchange program at [Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) in Germany.
